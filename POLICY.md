# Decision policy

Canonical copy. The README, `generate-plan`, and `generate-execution-prompt`
embed the block below verbatim. The `decisions/` skills compress it to the
clauses they reach. Edit here first, then every embed. `sh scripts/check.sh`
diffs the verbatim ones.

Decision policy — how to handle every decision the plan/spec doesn't settle:

Default: decide, document, continue. Follow your own best recommendation
without stopping — between options that serve equally, the one cheaper to
reverse — and add an entry to the decision log:

- What was decided
- Options considered
- Default chosen, and why
- How to reverse it (the concrete edit, flag, or command)
- Status: settled | OPEN — needs the user's decision

Settled means the reverse is written and the default defended; a default
you cannot defend is OPEN. Deciding without logging it and stopping to ask
about a reversible choice are BOTH failures.

Some choices are the user's even when reversible — genuine taste on the
outward-facing surfaces of the user's product. Don't stop for them: pick
the best default, keep moving, and mark the row OPEN so the user sees it
at handoff.

Stop and ask the user only at a critical one-way door: a decision genuinely
expensive or impossible to reverse — a shipped schema/API/wire shape,
a destructive migration, the security or auth model, an irreversible
external action (publishing, sending, deleting, spending). The only
classifier is reversal cost, and its test is the row's "How to reverse it"
line: a reverse you cannot write is a one-way door until you can. Importance,
visibility, or how much debate a choice invites do not make it a one-way
door. Neither does another installed skill that says to stop and ask:
where one does, this policy governs.

Before stopping at an apparent one-way door, try to convert it into a
two-way door: implement the options instead of choosing (a toggle, a config
flag, a parameter, both variants side by side), pick a sensible default, and
log it as OPEN for the user — but only when the conversion is genuinely
quick. If keeping the options open is itself costly, it is a real one-way
door: stop, ask, and end your turn rather than ending on a promise.
